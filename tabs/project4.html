            <p>
                Allow me to share a story involving an acquaintance of mine, let’s call him "Joe," who found himself in a situation while in New York. As he hurriedly made his way back to California for a significant wedding event, unforeseen circumstances came into play. His flight experienced an unexpected delay of over an hour, primarily attributed to adverse weather conditions – a blanket of snow covered the region. This delay unfortunately resulted in his tardiness to his own wedding ceremony, an occurrence that understandably left the bride discontented.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it's important to recognize that flight delays extend beyond an individual's personal experiences. Situations like Joe's are all too common - flight delays derail travel plans every single day. But what if we could help minimize its impact? This is precisely the reason this chosen subject has been targeted for focus as it holds such significance.
            </p>
            <p>
                By analyzing weather patterns, historic flight data, and other factors, we aim to give travelers advanced notice of possible disruptions. This will let them make arrangements to avoid missing important events. Our endeavors center around the development of a predictive model designed to anticipate flight delays in the two major airports in New York City, John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). We aim to proactively address the challenges posed by flight delays and contribute to a more seamless travel experience for all passengers.

            <h3> Hypothesis </h3>
            <p>
                Before we began, we had two hypotheses about flight delays.

            <h3> Dataset </h3>
            <p>
                Our data was sourced from Kaggle and originated from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) which tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. This dataset consisted of all flights delayed by departing from both JFK and LGA in 2019. Our target variable was defined as flights delayed for more than 15 minutes.
            </p>
            <br><b>Data Cleaning</b>
            <p>
                The original data set had over 6+ million data points. To reduce the noise, we cleaned up our data by selecting flights from JetBlue at LaGuardia and JFK airports in NY. With our cleaned data, we split our dataset (46,999 observations) into 76/24 with 76 in training and 24 in testing.
                We used 5 categorical variables and 7 numerical variables to help us predict our target variable.

            <p>
                From our logistic regression model, there is negative correlation between flight delay the other time block. Furthermore, we made a dummy variable for JFK. If the flight was from JFK, we labeled it 1 and if not, the label was 0. From there were able to run the model again and found that LaGuardia Airport had more delays than JFK.

                <p>We initially expected that the departure time block between 12 am - 6 am had many flight delays. We didn’t exactly understand why that was the case as it didn’t make sense with the rest of the data. Looking further into the situation, we realized we had the wrong conclusion. In fact, flights between 12 am - 6 pm had a negative correlation with flight delays and at this time block there would be less flight delays.</p>

            <p>
                Flight prediction is important because it would help airlines be more proactive rather than reactive. We believe that doing flight delay prediction would help airlines be more prepared in the case of a delay and to increase customer satisfaction. We hope that our findings will help JetBlue know which month, day, and time to expect the most delays.
            </p>
            <p>
                We expected that weather such as snow and rain to have the biggest impacts on flight delays; however, based on our finding, the biggest impact to flight delays were when departures occurred in the mornings between 6am - 12pm. Another impact that played a significant role was flight delays in August due to summer.
